    MOET - (MO)bile (E)xploratory (T)esting in Java

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Moet in java contains libraries for mobile simulators - Android, and iPhone.
i.e. Android.javay (works on physical devices too), and iPhone.java 

Tests are written such that they can be reused and run on Android, and iPhone. 
This is done by identifying customer use cases such as login, search, create 
contact etc. and each use case will utilize MOET library controls. 
Device type is determined at runtime.

Please read the file INSTALL for installation and usage instructions.

NOTE. This is only supported on the Mac for Android and iPhone.
