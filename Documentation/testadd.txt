     |      Create an instance of the class that will use the named test
     |      method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does

     |  assertAlmostEqual = failUnlessAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=7, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero.
     |      
     |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
     |      as significant digits (measured from the most signficant digit).
     |

     |      operator.
     |  
     |  assertFalse = failIf(self, expr, msg=None)
     |      Fail the test if the expression is true.

     |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero.

     |  assertRaises = failUnlessRaises(self, excClass, callableObj, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless an exception of class excClass is thrown
     |      by callableObj when invoked with arguments args and keyword
     |      arguments kwargs. If a different type of exception is
     |      thrown, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
     |      deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
     |      unexpected exception.

     |  
     |  failUnlessRaises(self, excClass, callableObj, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless an exception of class excClass is thrown
     |      by callableObj when invoked with arguments args and keyword
     |      arguments kwargs. If a different type of exception is
     |      thrown, it will not be caught, and the test case will be

     |  shortDescription(self)
     |      Returns a one-line description of the test, or None if no
     |      description has been provided.
     |      
     |      The default implementation of this method returns the first line of
     |      the specified test method's docstring.
