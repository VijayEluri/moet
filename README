"moet" contains libraries for mobile simulators (Blackberry, Android so far)
to control behavior of the simulator and your mobile application using a common
python scripting environment. Mobile demos and tests can be built easily without
dealing with how each device simulator is implemented. This will not incur any 
costs such as acquiring a device and at the same time, achieve high quality of 
native mobile applications.

Tests are written such that they can be reused and run against any devices. 
This is done by identifying customer use cases such as login, search, create 
contact etc. and each use case will utilize the simulator library controls. 
Device simulator type (BB/Android/iPhone) is determined at runtime, 
based on the environment setting.

Depending on the device support, tests may even execute with the device in 
addition to the simulator.

Please read the file INSTALL for installation and usage instructions.
